# Directory Tree Generator
This is the main project that I've made. I've done it in two ways:<br>
1. One with the interface that I’m going to call as DTG_GUI.<br>
2. Another one with command-line whose output will be displayed on command-line that I’m going to call as DTG_CMD.

# Description
An Internship project describes the development of Directory Tree Generator using python.<br>
The goal of this project is to make it easier to understand the positioning of files and directories. A directory tree map is important when you’re explaining certain concepts, and a Directory Tree Generator makes it easier to get a visual representation of the file and directory relationships.
